# Deployed to Vercel

https://real-estate-app-with-firebase.vercel.app/

It's a web application which involves ReactJS, CSS and Firebase. Signing up/in is possible with Google authentication provided by firebase, posting new advertisements, seeing your own listings under Profile or even deleting them is possible when signed in. There are also some other features like changing display name, email address, contacting landlords (author of the particular listing), requesting a password reminder via email and last, but not least, a map is implemented with Leaflet.
